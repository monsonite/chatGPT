Amazing what AI can do
Techie People

She came from Wales she had a thirst for knowledge

She studied computing at Bangor College

That's where I

Caught her eye

She told me that her code had loaded

I said, in that case I'll play PacMan with you

She said fine

And then in thirty seconds time she said

I wanna code like Techie people

I wanna do what BASIC coders do

Wanna code with Techie people

I wanna code with nerdy Hackers

Like you

Oh what else could I do

I said I'll see what I can do



I took her to a surplus market

I don't know why

But I had to start it somewhere

So it started there

I said you've gotta spend some money

She just laughed and said

Oh you're so funny

I said; yeah

I can't see anyone else shopping in here

Can you?


You wanna code like Techie people

You wanna see what nerdy hackers see

Wanna code with Techie people

You wanna code with geeky people

Like me

But she didn't understand

She just laughed and held my mouse

Rent a grotty student house

Drink some beer and smoke some pot

Write some code and play some pool

Pretend you never went to school

But still you'll never get it right

'Cause when you're hacking late at night

Seeing damp mould on the wall

Call your dad and he'd fix it all, yeah



You'll never hack like Techie people

You'll never do whatever nerdy hackers do

You'll never fail like geeky people

You'll never watch your grades crash out of view

And you dance and drink then spew

Because there's nothing else to do

Code along with the Techie people

Hack all night and it might just get you through

Code along with the nerdy people

Code along even when they're really joshing with you

And the stupid things you do

Because you think that tech is cool


Like a PET, left in a corner

It will crash and never warn you

Lose your program, start to sweat

'Cause everybody hates a Commie PET

Especially one that's short of RAM

Yeah with it's poxy chiclet keyboard

Will never run floating point math

Will you never understand

How it feels to lose your app

Fatal pokes lose screen control

And with nowhere left to go

You are amazed how they exist

And the screen it burn so bright

Whilst you can only wonder why



Rent a nasty student flat

Logitech mouse and mat

Smoke some pot and play some pool

Pretend you never went to school

But still you'll never get it right

'Cause when you're hacking through the night

Watching dampness on the wall

Call your dad and he'd fix it all

Yeah

Never code like Techie people

Never do what nerdy hackers do

Never fail like Techie people

You'll only watch your grades slip out of view

And then you dance and drink then spew

Because there's nothing else to do


Wanna code like Techie people like you

Wanna hack with nerdy people like you

Wanna code with Techie people like you

Wanna hack with geeky people like you

Wanna code with Techie people like you

Wanna live like nerdy people like you

I wanna live with common hackers like you

Oh, la, la, la, la

Oh, la, la, la, la

Oh, la, la, la, la

Oh, la, la, la, la

Oh Yeah
