Amazing what AI can do

Techie People

She came from Wales she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied computing at Bangor College
That's where I
Caught her eye
She told me that her code had loaded
I said, in that case I'll play PacMan with you
She said fine
And then in thirty seconds time she said
I wanna code like Techie people
I wanna do what BASIC coders do
Wanna code with Techie people
I wanna code with nerdy Hackers
Like you
Oh what else could I do
I said I'll see what I can do


I took her to a surplus market
I don't know why
But I had to start it somewhere
So it started there
I said you've gotta spend some money
She just laughed and said
Oh you're so funny
I said; yeah
I can't see anyone else shopping in here
Can you?


You wanna code like Techie people
You wanna see what nerdy hackers see
Wanna code with Techie people
You wanna code with geeky people
Like me
But she didn't understand
She just laughed and held my mouse
Rent a grotty student house
Drink some beer and smoke some pot
Write some code and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cause when you're hacking late at night
Seeing damp mould on the wall
Call your dad and he'd fix it all, yeah


You'll never hack like Techie people
You'll never do whatever nerdy hackers do
You'll never fail like geeky people
You'll never watch your grades crash out of view
And you dance and drink then spew
Because there's nothing else to do
Code along with the Techie people
Hack all night and it might just get you through
Code along with the nerdy people
Code along even when they're really joshing with you
And the stupid things you do
Because you think that tech is cool

Like a PET, left in a corner
It will crash and never warn you
Lose your program, start to sweat
'Cause everybody hates a Commie PET
Especially one that's short of RAM
Yeah with it's poxy chiclet keyboard
Will never run floating point math
Will you never understand
How it feels to lose your app
Fatal pokes lose screen control
And with nowhere left to go
You are amazed how they exist
And the screen it burn so bright
Whilst you can only wonder why


Rent a nasty student flat
Logitech mouse and mat
Smoke some pot and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cause when you're hacking through the night
Watching dampness on the wall
Call your dad and he'd fix it all
Yeah
Never code like Techie people
Never do what nerdy hackers do
Never fail like Techie people
You'll only watch your grades slip out of view
And then you dance and drink then spew
Because there's nothing else to do

Wanna code like Techie people like you
Wanna hack with nerdy people like you
Wanna code with Techie people like you
Wanna hack with geeky people like you
Wanna code with Techie people like you
Wanna live like nerdy people like you
I wanna live with common hackers like you
Oh, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la
Oh Yeah
